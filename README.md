## About
This is a small single paged website designed to time popular sorting algorithms. It works by parsing a text file into an array of numbers, before updating the page HTML, timing each sorting function then dynamically filling an HTML table with the timed results. Data parsing utilised Regex and JavaScript array functions.
### Current sorting implementations are:
* Quick Sort
* Merge Sort
* Heap Sort
* Bubble Sort
* Selection Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Counting Sort
